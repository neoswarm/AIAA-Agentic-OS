# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Non-technical users can discover, configure, execute, and receive output from any of 133 AI skills through the web dashboard without ever touching a terminal, and when something goes wrong, they understand exactly what happened and how to fix it.
**Current focus:** Phases 2-9 (parallelizable after Phase 1 baseline verified)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Input Validation)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress -- 02-02 complete, 02-01 and 02-03 remaining
Last activity: 2026-02-22 -- Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (server-side API validation)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-regression-baseline | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 02-input-validation | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min, 2min
- Trend: consistent fast execution

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Brownfield hardening (not rewrite) -- existing UX overhaul is the foundation
- Vanilla JS stack (no React/Vue migration)
- SQLite (no Postgres migration)
- Phases 2-9 are parallelizable after Phase 1 baseline
- API v1 session key mismatch (authenticated vs logged_in) documented as pre-existing issue, not fixed in baseline phase
- /setup redirect when password configured is expected behavior, not a bug
- validation_error() helper centralizes structured error format for all API v2 endpoints
- Collect all field errors before returning (user sees all problems at once)
- Skill execute validates required params from parsed SKILL.md metadata dynamically

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API v1 protected endpoints return 401 for session-authenticated users due to session key mismatch (api.py checks `session['authenticated']`, login sets `session['logged_in']`). Should be addressed in a future hardening phase.
